# number_guessing_game
A number guessing game in Python is a small program where the computer picks a random number, and the player tries to guess it. After each guess, the program tells the player whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.

# Number Guessing Game (Python)

## Description
This is a simple Python number guessing game. The computer randomly chooses a number between 1 and 10, and the player has 5 chances to guess the correct number.

## How the Game Works
- The program generates a random number from 1 to 10.
- The user enters a guess.
- After each guess, the program tells the user if the secret number is higher or lower.
- The game ends when the user guesses correctly or uses all 5 attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Uses Python’s built-in random module

## How to Run
1. Save the code in a file (for example: guessing_game.py)
2. Run the file using:

3. Follow the instructions shown on the screen.

## Output Examples
- The secret number is higher
- The secret number is lower
- Helll Yeahhh!! You guessed in X attempts
- Better luck next time!! The secret number was X

## Purpose
This project helps beginners practice:
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- User input
